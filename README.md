# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences, providing a comprehensive view of my professional journey.

- **Deployment:** Hosted seamlessly on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring fast and reliable performance.

### Portfolio Highlights
1. **Home Page:** A visually appealing introduction with interactive elements.
2. **Projects Section:** Showcases my top projects with descriptions and live links.
3. **About Me:** An overview of my professional background, skills, and values.
4. **Contact:** A direct way to get in touch with me, complete with form submission.
5. **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## Motivation for Migration

Previously, my portfolio was built with a traditional static website generator. While functional, it lacked modern web capabilities like:

- Efficient server-side rendering for improved SEO and load times.
- Scalability and modularity offered by Next.js.
- Advanced routing and API integration options.

Switching to Next.js allowed me to create a dynamic, high-performance portfolio that is future-proof and easy to maintain.
